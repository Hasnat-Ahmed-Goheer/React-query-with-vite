## Introduction

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast development server and a next-generation frontend tooling that supports React out of the box. [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is a powerful library for managing, caching, and synchronizing server state in React applications.

This repository aims to provide hands-on practice and examples to demonstrate the seamless integration of Vite, React, and React Query using TypeScript.
